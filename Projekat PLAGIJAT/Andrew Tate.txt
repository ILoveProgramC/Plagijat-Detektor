Emory Andrew Tate III (born 1 December 1986) is an American-British media personality, businessman, and former professional kickboxer. He began practicing kickboxing in 2005 and gained his first championship in 2009. He attracted wider attention in 2016 when he appeared on the British reality show Big Brother. He was removed from the show after a video emerged of Tate repeatedly striking a woman with a belt; the two later stated the act was consensual. He began operating a camgirl business and selling online courses, and rose to fame as an internet celebrity, promoting an "ultra-masculine, ultra-luxurious lifestyle". Tate's misogynistic commentary has resulted in his suspension from various social media platforms.[3][4][5][6]

He made international headlines when in December 2022, Tate and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania along with two women; all four are suspected of human trafficking and forming an organised crime group. Romanian police alleged that the group coerced victims into creating paid pornography.[7] In March 2023, all four were moved to house arrest while the investigation continued, after being held in custody since their arrest.[8][9] In June, they were charged with rape, human trafficking, and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women. Tate and his brother deny all charges.
