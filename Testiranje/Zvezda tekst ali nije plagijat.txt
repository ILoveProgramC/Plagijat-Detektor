
The starting lineup for Red Star in the 1991 European Cup Final against Marseille was coached by Ljupko Petrović. Following Zec's departure in 1986, significant changes took place within the club. Under the management of Dragan Džajić and Vladimir Cvetković, Red Star began assembling a team capable of competing with the top European clubs. Velibor Vasović took over as coach, and the team was bolstered by the addition of talented young players like Dragan Stojković and Borislav Cvetković. The club's focus shifted towards the European Cup, with a clear goal of achieving success in the competition.

In 1987, a five-year plan was devised with the sole objective of winning the European Cup, a goal that was eventually realized. Real Madrid was defeated at the Marakana, marking the beginning of Red Star's most successful period in history. Over the next five seasons, the club secured four National Championships and clinched the 1991 European Cup Final in Bari, Italy.

Coach Ljupko Petrović led Red Star to Italy a week before the final to adequately prepare the players for the encounter with Marseille. Despite expectations of an offensive spectacle, both teams opted for a defensive approach, resulting in a tightly contested match. Following a goalless 120 minutes, the outcome was determined by a penalty shootout. Red Star emerged victorious, with Darko Pančev converting the decisive penalty, securing the European Cup for Yugoslavia for the first time.

In the subsequent season of 1992, the club faced challenges due to the departure of key players from the championship-winning team. Offers from European giants and the logistical challenges posed by the war in Yugoslavia affected Red Star's ability to defend their continental title. Despite playing home games abroad and changes in the format of the European Cup, Red Star performed commendably, finishing second in their group.

The period following 1992 was marked by adversity, including the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav Wars, inflation, and UN sanctions. Despite these challenges, Red Star managed to secure one championship victory and several cup wins, along with memorable European performances. Notably, the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup triumph against Barcelona remains a highlight in the club's history.
